# COSC 499 Individual GitHub Exercise
## Mashad Chowdhury
For this exercise, I have used two simple features in Java. One is to sort out an array of integers, and the second is to sort out a list of Strings. I have also used JUnit tests to test my code to check whether the desired output is displayed, and both tests were successful, as can be seen in the video.

Each feature has a branch, plus the master branch which is this one. Read the README.md files from each branch to learn more about the features and how to use it.
