# Feature 2 - Sorting Strings
For this feature, I have made use of both Lists and Arrays to sort a List of Strings containing various names of cities in BC, in alphebetical order in ascending order. I used the command Arrays.asList(...) to store the Strings, and then used the Collections package to sort it out in alphabetical order.
