# COSC 499 Individual GitHub Exercise
## Mashad Chowdhury
For this exercise, I have used two simple features in Java. One is to sort out an array of integers, and the second is to sort out a list of Strings. Each feature has a branch, plus the master branch which is this one. Read the README.md files from each branch to learn more about the features and how to use it.
